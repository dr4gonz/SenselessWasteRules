# Keeper Rules
- Any Player that is taken in the rookie draft, auction draft, added from waivers or acquired by trade is eligible to be kept for the following season.

- A player can be kept for as many season's as the team's owner decides to keep him.

- If kept for a second season, a player’s base salary is equal to the acquisition cost in draft of FAAB dollars. Salaries increase by $10 during the first contract extension (second season), another $10 during the second contract extension (third season) and $15/year for any additional years of service (four or more seasons). Refer to example 1 below.

- A player’s salary added off of waivers for $0 converts to $1.

- A player drafted in auction then dropped to waivers is kept at their waiver price + contract extension, not their auction price + extension. Refer to example 2 below.

- Teams that finish 1-4 after the fantasy playoffs can keep 4 players for the following season.

- Teams that finish 5-10 after the playoffs can keep 6 players for the following season.

- Keepers need to be finalized 3 days before draft day at 8PM PST

- A traded players "Kept Years" will reset when traded, but their value for keeper calculations the following year will use the current years price. See "Trade Example" for details.

## Example 1
In 2019, a player is drafted in auction for $25 or acquired for $25 with FAAB dollars during the regular season.
- 2019: $25
- 2020: $25 + $10 (1st extension) = $35
- 2021: $35 + $10 = $45
- 2022: $45 + $15 = $60

## Example 2
In 2019, a player is drafted in auction for $25, dropped, and picked up by a new manager for $40 with FAAB dollars during the regular season.
- 2019: $25
- 2020: $40 + $10 (1st extension) = $50
- 2021: $50 + $10 = $60
- 2022: $60 + $15 = $75

## Trade Example
In 2022, Team A drafts J. Taylor for $50. They keep J. Taylor for the 2023 season. (Kept Years = 1)
- 2022 (Year 0): $50
- 2023 (Year 1): $60
In 2023, Team A trades J. Taylor to Team B. Kept Years for B will be 0 for the current year, 2023. The price for J. Taylor remains $60.

In 2024, Team B decides to keep J. Taylor
- 2024 (Year 1): $70
